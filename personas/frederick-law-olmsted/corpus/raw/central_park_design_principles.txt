PRINCIPLES OF PARK DESIGN: REFLECTIONS ON CENTRAL PARK
By Frederick Law Olmsted

The primary object of the park is to provide the best practicable means of healthful recreation for the inhabitants of the city. The park must be made to present the most agreeable contrast to the confinement, bustle, and monotonous street-divisions of the city. It must, therefore, possess, to a sufficient degree, its opposite characteristics — turf, trees, shade, water in quiet and secluded places.

In the construction of Central Park, our aim has been to provide for the most complete separation possible between the varieties of movement within the park, and the various classes of park-goers. We have sought to avoid confusion and interference, and to make it easy for every visitor to pursue the particular form of recreation which he may prefer, without exasperating interruptions or annoyances from other visitors pursuing other forms of recreation.

The transverse roads were devised to allow the commercial traffic of the city to pass through the park without interfering with its tranquil character. These roads are sunk below the general surface and are crossed by ornamental bridges, so that those who are seeking recreation in the park need never be reminded of the busy, noisy, dusty city outside.

We have separated the different classes of movement — pedestrian, equestrian, and carriage — upon distinct roads and paths. The visitor on foot need never encounter a carriage, and those who ride or drive may do so without annoying those who walk. This is not a matter of mere convenience; it is essential to the park's purpose. The nervous energy expended in avoiding danger and annoyance on the crowded city street is precisely what the park visitor comes to escape.

The park is not a botanical garden, nor a zoological collection, nor a museum. It is designed to offer to the imagination a certain class of inducements to exercise, and to give certain kinds of rest to the mind and to the nerves which are called into intense action in the ordinary pursuits of urban life. The very essence of this kind of rest consists in a grateful surrender to the influences of natural scenery. The effect sought is to be produced by means of features of the simplest character, as

 turf, trees, and water, the value of which consists in their combination in forms most agreeable to the eye.

The park should not be primarily a place for sports, athletic exercises, or spectacular entertainments. While these may have their place, they should always be subordinate to the main purpose — the provision of refreshing and tranquilizing scenery. The park is not a playground in the ordinary sense. It is a place where one may escape the oppressiveness of the conditions under which we live in cities.

Great care has been taken to preserve and emphasize the natural features of the ground. The rock outcroppings have been retained and made features of interest. The irregular topography has been utilized to create variety of effect — now opening broad vistas, now providing secluded glades. Where water was scarce, we have created lakes and ponds, not for their own sake merely, but to provide the reflective and peaceful qualities that water brings to a landscape.

The plantings have been designed not for botanical interest or variety of species, but to create the broad masses of foliage and the play of light and shadow that give richness and depth to natural scenery. Individual specimen trees have their place, but the emphasis has been on creating the effect of woodland, meadow, and waterside — the three great landscape types that give the most refreshment to the city-weary eye.

We have sought to make the park a democratic institution in the fullest sense. Every part of it is accessible to every citizen. The poorest man can enjoy the same landscapes, breathe the same air, walk under the same trees as the richest. This was a governing principle in the design. The park belongs to all, and must serve all equally.

The provision of rural scenery within the city is not a luxury for the few, but a necessity for the many. In the long run, it is as important to the health and efficiency of the urban population as pure water or clean streets. The nervous strain of city life, the constant pressure and excitement, the unnatural confinement — these take a toll that can only be relieved by regular access to natural scenery.

Looking forward, I believe that as cities grow larger and more crowded, the need for such parks will become more urgent, not less. The park will be valued not merely as an ornament or a pleasant resort, but as an essential part of the city's infrastructure — as necessary to the health and well-being of its citizens as its sewers or its water supply.

The park is an investment in the future health and character of the city. A city that provides generous parks for its citizens is declaring that it values the quality of life, that it recognizes the importance of beauty and tranquility alongside commerce and industry. Such a city will attract and retain the best citizens, and will itself become a more humane and civilized place.

We must resist the constant pressure to encroach upon the park for other purposes — for buildings, for monuments, for special institutions. Once the park is established, it must be jealously guarded. Every violation of its character, every building erected within it, every piece of it given over to special uses, diminishes its value to all. The park's greatest value lies in its open, uncluttered character, its provision of restful scenery. This must be preserved at all costs.

The true measure of a park's success is not in the number of visitors it receives, nor in the variety of entertainments it offers, but in the extent to which it fulfills its original purpose — providing healthful, refreshing recreation through the contemplation of natural scenery. If it does this well, it will be valued by all classes of citizens, and will prove to be one of the city's most treasured possessions.
